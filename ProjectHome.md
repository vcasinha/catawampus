**Catawampus** [kat-uh-wom-puhs]
  1. askew; awry.
  1. diagonal; cater-cornered.

Catawampus is an open source implementation of [tr-69](http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp.php), the CPE WAN Management Protocol. CWMP allows a carrier to remotely provision, troubleshoot, and manage equipment at the customer premises. Catawampus is a CWMP agent, which runs on the CPE device.

The name "Catawampus" was chosen based on its ability to contain the letters C-W-M-P in the proper order.

Catawampus is at present not sufficiently complete to use as a tr-69 CPE agent. Work is ongoing.
